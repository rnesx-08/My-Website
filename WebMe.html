        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>You knew her as Shekinah, or Mitch but most of her closest friends and family calls her Miki. 
        She was often looked up to when she was in Pre-school for her confidence. She is an exceptional warrior.
        Her greatest defense is silence.Meekness is her strong foundation. She's won battles without a fight.
        She can be as imperfect as the moon, but she is still lovely and fascinating. Shekinah usually enjoys listening to metal, rnb, and opm music. Silent Sanctuary, Secondhand Serenade, and My Chemical Romance are her favorite bands. 
        Her interest in music began while she was in sixth level. She took advantage of the opportunity to audition for a Chorale and was fortunate to be accepted! 
        Her voice range is Alto, but the Choir master discovered after a week of singing that being in a Soprano range suits her perfectly. From sixth through eighth grade,
        she was a member of the San Damiano Youth Chorale.It was never her intent to quit singing and ministering at the parish, but she realized she needed to prioritize her studies.</p>
